HytaleJS provides 30+ events for player actions, world changes, and server lifecycle.

## Basic Usage

Use the `@EventListener` decorator to handle events:

```typescript
import { type PlayerConnectEvent, EventListener } from "@hytalejs.com/core";

class MyPlugin {
  @EventListener("PlayerConnectEvent")
  onJoin(event: PlayerConnectEvent) {
    const player = event.getPlayer();
    player.sendMessage(Message.raw("Welcome!"));
  }
}
```

## Cancelling Events

Some events can be cancelled to prevent the default action:

```typescript
@EventListener("PlayerChatEvent")
onChat(event: PlayerChatEvent) {
  if (event.getContent().includes("badword")) {
    event.setCancelled(true);
    event.getSender().sendMessage(Message.raw("Watch your language!"));
  }
}
```
